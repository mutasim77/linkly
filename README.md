# Linkly - Link Smarter, Not Harder 🔗
 
## The (Embarrassing) Origin Story
It started with a shocking moment of clarity: I was sitting with a friend when we counted my open browser tabs - **72 TABS**. *Seventy. Two. Tabs.* My laptop fan was screaming for mercy, my RAM was on life support, and that's when I realized I had a problem.

Sure, there are fancy browsers like Arc and Zen that promise to fix tab hoarding, but I had already deleted them all in a cycle of downloading-promising-to-organize-giving-up. So here we are!

I've missed working with Vue for way too long, so I decided to build this tiny project that I'll actually use myself. Sometimes the best solutions are the ones you build with your own hands (and tears... lots of tears from closing all those precious tabs).

## What is Linkly?
Linkly is a simple, elegant way to store and organize all your important links in one place. It's like therapy for tab hoarders.

## Features (or, "Why I Can Finally Close My 72 Tabs")

- 🔍 **Save links with descriptive names** - No more "what was that site again?"
- 🏷️ **Organize with custom tags** - Because folders are so last decade
- 🔎 **Quick search** - Find that link faster than you can say "which tab was it in?"
- 🌓 **Dark/light mode** - For both your daytime productivity and 3 AM browsing sessions
- 💾 **Local storage** - Your links live in your browser, no account needed
- 📱 **Responsive design** - Works on all your devices (so you can hoard links on mobile too!)
- 🖼️ **Link previews** - With rich thumbnails for YouTube and other media sites
